# ITNA_Connectivity
This is a repository for my "Inferior Temporal Numeral Area Connectivity" project under Dr. Gavin Price. We look at structural and functional connectivity of this area (which has been shown to preferentially process numerals compared to other symbols) using streamline tractography (white-matter projections) and beta-series correlations (task-evoked coupling). We further assess the extent to which connectivity of this region relates to its functional selectivity (within a digit/letter detection task).

The repo contains the collection of MATLAB scripts/functions used for preprocessing both the fMRI and DWI data, as well as pipelines for structural and functional connectivity, statistical analyses, and figure generation.

Connectivity analyses are surface-based and use cortical surfaces generated by FreeSurfer's recon-all pipeline.

External toolboxes needed are AFNI, MRtrix3 (and a fork of it called MRtrix3Tissue), and FSL.

Additional code used from the Vanderbilt MASILab includes a wrapper for FSL preprocessing provided at https://github.com/justinblaber/topup_eddy_preprocess and nonlinear distortion correction procedure provided by https://github.com/MASILab/Synb0-DISCO 

*NOTE - References to acronym NFA ("Number Form Area") are present throughout this code. NFA is synonymous with ITNA, but we as a lab have moved on to using ITNA as it is a more appropriate functional label for the region.
