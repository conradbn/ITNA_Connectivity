# NFA_Stucture_Function
Price "Number Form Area" project looking at tractography, functional activation (digit/letter detection task), and relation to math in n=29 healthy adults

Project contains the collection of MATLAB scripts used for preprocessing and tractography, as well as postprocessing, statistical analysis, and figure generation

External toolboxes needed are FSL, AFNI, MRtrix3

Additional code used from the Vanderbilt MASILab includes a wrapper for FSL preprocessing provided at https://github.com/justinblaber/topup_eddy_preprocess and nonlinear distortion correction procedure provided by https://github.com/MASILab/Synb0-DISCO
